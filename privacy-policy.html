    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> June 26, 2025</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how your information is handled in our mobile game (the “App”), which is developed and published by Eagle (“we,” “our,” or “the Developer”).</p>

    <p>Your privacy matters to us. This policy explains what information we do — and <strong>do not</strong> — collect, how we use it, and your rights in relation to that information.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>At this time, our app is <strong>fully offline</strong> and does <strong>not collect, store, transmit, or share</strong> any personal data from its users. Specifically:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>No personal identifiers (e.g., names, email addresses, phone numbers)</li>
      <li>No location data</li>
      <li>No financial or payment information</li>
      <li>No device information or usage statistics</li>
      <li>No gameplay analytics</li>
      <li>No advertising or tracking technologies</li>
      <li>No cookies or similar technologies</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All data related to gameplay remains entirely on your device and is never transmitted to us or any third party.</p>

    <h2>2. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our app does not knowingly collect or solicit any personal information from individuals under the age of 13 (or the equivalent minimum age in your jurisdiction). Since the app collects no data, there is no risk of storing or sharing information related to children.</p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We do not integrate any third-party SDKs, libraries, or services that would transmit user data. This includes but is not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>No Google Analytics</li>
      <li>No AdMob or advertising services</li>
      <li>No Facebook SDK</li>
      <li>No crash reporting tools (e.g., Firebase Crashlytics)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If third-party services are added in the future, this policy will be updated and users will be informed accordingly.</p>

    <h2>4. Future Changes and Advertising</h2>
    <p>While our app is currently offline and free of advertising, we may introduce <strong>optional online features or advertising services</strong> in future updates.</p>
    <p>If and when such features are introduced:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>This Privacy Policy will be updated to reflect new data practices.</li>
      <li>User consent will be obtained where required by law.</li>
      <li>We will remain compliant with all relevant regulations and platform policies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Your Rights and Control</h2>
    <p>Since we do not collect or store any personal data, there is no information for users to access, modify, or delete. If data collection begins in the future, users will be informed of their rights under applicable laws such as GDPR or CCPA.</p>

    <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or the game, please contact us at:</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time. Changes will be effective immediately upon posting. If the changes materially affect your rights or involve any new form of data collection, you will be notified in advance through the app or app store listing.</p>
